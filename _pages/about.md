  I graduated with a doctoral degree from Tsinghua University in 2025. I am expert on modelling and simulating the compressible two-phase multi-component reactive flows, with applications in both fundamental research and engineering scenarios:

- Diffuse-interface methods
- Droplet aerobreakup(Shock/Detonation)
- Gaseous/droplet-laden two-phase detonation
- Adaptive mesh refinement (tree-based)
- Underwater shock-bubble interactions
